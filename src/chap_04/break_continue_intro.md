	Using `break` and `continue` in Loops
</div>

In this section, we will explore the use of the `break` and `continue` statements in Rust loops. These control flow statements provide additional flexibility and control over loop execution, allowing you to exit a loop early or skip the remaining iteration and proceed to the next one.

### What We Will Cover

1. **Introduction to `break`**:
   - Understanding how the `break` statement works.
   - Practical examples of using `break` to exit loops early.
   - Scenarios where `break` is useful, such as terminating infinite loops and exiting nested loops with labels.

2. **Introduction to `continue`**:
   - Understanding how the `continue` statement works.
   - Practical examples of using `continue` to skip iterations.
   - Scenarios where `continue` is beneficial, such as skipping unwanted values in data processing and managing control flow in complex loops.

3. **Combining `break` and `continue`**:
   - Using both `break` and `continue` within a single loop to achieve complex control flow.
   - Best practices for maintaining readability and avoiding common pitfalls.

4. **Advanced Use Cases**:
   - Using labeled `break` and `continue` for enhanced control in nested loops.
   - Performance considerations and how the use of these statements can impact the efficiency of your code.

By the end of this section, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to use `break` and `continue` statements effectively in Rust loops.
