    Looping in Rust
</div>

Loops are fundamental control flow constructs in Rust that facilitate the repeated execution of a block of code. They are essential in performing repetitive tasks efficiently and are pivotal in many algorithms and system operations. Rust, as a systems programming language, provides robust loop constructs that offer control, efficiency, and safety. This introduction will delve into the types of loops available in Rust: `loop`, `while`, and `for`. Each type of loop caters to different scenarios and requirements, providing Rust programmers with flexible tools for iteration.

### Types of Loops

1. **Looping with `loop`**

   The `loop` keyword creates an infinite loop. This type of loop will continue executing indefinitely unless explicitly terminated using control flow mechanisms like `break`. The `loop` construct is useful for situations where the number of iterations is not known beforehand or when the loop needs to run until a certain condition is met, which is checked inside the loop body.

2. **The `while` Loop**

   The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition evaluates to `true`. This type of loop is ideal for scenarios where the condition must be evaluated before each iteration, and the loop should terminate when the condition is no longer met. It is particularly useful for loops that depend on dynamic conditions, such as user input or data from external sources.

3. **The `for` Loop**

   The `for` loop is used to iterate over a collection of elements, such as arrays, vectors, or ranges. This loop type is preferred when the number of iterations is known or when iterating over a sequence of values. The `for` loop in Rust is concise and powerful, leveraging Rustâ€™s iterator traits to provide efficient and readable iteration over collections.

In the following sections, we will explore each type of loop in detail, providing examples and discussing their appropriate use cases in Rust programming.
