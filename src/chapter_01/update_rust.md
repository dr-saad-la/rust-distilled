# Updating Rust

Updating Rust on different platforms is streamlined by the use of `rustup` command, the `Rustâ€™s` official toolchain installer and manager.

The **Rustup** provides a uniform way to manage Rust versions across various environments. To update Rust using Rustup, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```
rustup update
```

This command checks for the latest stable version of Rust, downloads it, and updates your system to use it. It's applicable to Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## After Updating

After updating, you can verify the installation and check the current version by running:

```
rustc --version
```

This command will display the version of Rust currently installed, ensuring that your update was successful.
